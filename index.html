                <p style="text-align: left;"> “THE BOOK WAS BETTER THAN THE MOVIE” – It’s a phrase we hear way too often, often uttered by diehard fans of books or series of books that are then disappointed by their big-screen counterpart. In recent times, studios have taken a backseat to writing new stories and have allowed writers to take the spotlight, using previously-written novels and stories as basis for motion pictures. But is this always the smart choice? As movies have fanbases, so do novels. And some of these fans will go to great lengths to defend their favorites. Sometimes movie adaptations will leave book fans saying the aforementioned phrase: “the book was better than the movie. The Data Dugongs have decided to put this phrase to the test, by comparing the Goodreads ratings of books to the IMDB ratings of their movie counterparts. 
<br/> 
<br/>                    
Our inspiration came from looking at both Goodreads and IMDB ratings charts: they both have a lot of data, valuable in everyday life to users looking to pick out their next medium for entertainment. Our main idea came from two already-existing datasets from Goodreads. 
<br/>
<br/>                    
The first <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/429.The_BOOK_was_BETTER_than_the_MOVIE"> list </a> is literally titled “The Book was Better than the Movie.” In this dataset, a list of books are ranked, from “greatest book in comparison to worst movie” to “worst book in comparison to greatest movie.”
<br/>
<br/>                    
The second <a href= "https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/104.The_MOVIE_was_BETTER_than_the_BOOK"> list </a> is the opposite of the claim, and is titled as such: “The Movie was Better than the Book.” The entries were listed, and they were ranked on movie upvotes. 
<br/>
<br/>                    
The lists together contain 2,511 books, however, when repeating offenders appeared, and we narrowed it down to well-known titles, we are drawing from 231 movie/book combinations to make our datasets.

                    <p> The Data Dugongs first wanted to see how the famous phrase held up against real data. In general, is the book REALLY better than the movie? We took to social media to find out.</p>
                    <p> Social media, as of recent, has become an amazing medium for polling. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter have incorporated polling into their everyday status updates for functionality purposes, making it easy for users to generate and ask their fanbases questions. We used this to our advantage and, using Instagram and Twitter, polled our personal followers to see how books held up against movies. </p>
                    <p> After the polling window closed, we had just shy of 100 users, in total, respond to our polls (65 on Instagram, 31 on Twitter) As seen above, books won out over their movie counterparts. While this was only a general survey, it seems the peers we surround ourselves with would much rather read a novel than watch a movie. But let's look bigger... </p>

                    <p> Goodreads and IMDB are overall hubs for book-reading and movie-watching, respectively. Users can contribute their own synopses, comments, and, in this case, ratings to titles they have read/seen. Goodreads and IMDB are the "Wikipedia of Entertainment" - as all of the site's content is user-submitted. For ratings, Goodreads and IMDB both use "star-rating" systems - where users rank content and then the ratings are averaged together. IMDB's rating system is based on 1 to 10 stars, and Goodreads 1 to 5 - therefore we doubled Goodreads' average rating to make the above graph. </p>
                    <p> As previously said, The Data Dugongs have been looking at 231 entries in an attempt to solve the age-old rivalry between book and movie. When we put averaged the ratings of the 231 films and the 231 books they are based off of, the rating for the books overall triumphs over the overall rating for movies by 1.03 stars. </p>
                    <p> This data supports the aforementioned statement - "the book is better than the movie."  When looking at user-rated systems, it shows that the data is closer than we previously predicted. This was also supported by the social media polling. After posting a general poll, The Data Dugongs received quite a few messages: </p>
                    <p> "It depends," one user wrote. </p>
                    <p> Book, but sometimes it's easier to watch the movie then read the book" </p>
                    <p> While the general question "book or movie?" varies from person to person, for the second time in a row: book wins. </p>
