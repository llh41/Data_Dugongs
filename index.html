                <p style="text-align: left;"> “THE BOOK WAS BETTER THAN THE MOVIE” – It’s a phrase we hear too often, frequently uttered by diehard fans of books or series of books that are then disappointed by their big-screen counterpart. In recent times, studios have taken a backseat to writing new stories and have allowed established authors to take the spotlight, using previously-written novels and stories as basis for motion pictures. But is this always the smart choice? As movies have fanbases, so do novels. And some of these fans will go to great lengths to defend their favorites. Sometimes movie adaptations will leave book fans saying the aforementioned phrase: “the book was better than the movie." The Data Dugongs have decided to put this phrase to the test, by comparing the Goodreads ratings of books to the IMDB ratings of their movie counterparts. 
<br/> 
<br/>                    
Our inspiration came from looking at both Goodreads and IMDB ratings charts: they both have a lot of data, valuable in everyday life to users looking to pick out their next source of entertainment. Our main idea came from two already-existing datasets from Goodreads. 
<br/>
<br/>                    
The first <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/429.The_BOOK_was_BETTER_than_the_MOVIE"> list </a> is literally titled “The Book was Better than the Movie.” In this dataset, a list of books are ranked, from “greatest book in comparison to worst movie” to “worst book in comparison to greatest movie.”
<br/>
<br/>                    
The second <a href= "https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/104.The_MOVIE_was_BETTER_than_the_BOOK"> list </a> is the opposite of the claim, and is titled as such: “The Movie was Better than the Book.” The entries were listed, and they were ranked on movie upvotes. 
<br/>
<br/>                    
The lists together contain 2,511 books, however, when repeating offenders appeared, and we narrowed it down to well-known titles, we are drawing from 231 movie/book combinations to make our datasets.

                    <p> Before analyzing the ratings of thousands of book and movie combinations, The Data Dugongs first wanted to see how the famous phrase held up on a small-scale -- In general, is the book REALLY better than the movie? We took to social media to find out.</p>
                    <p> Social media, as of recent, has become an amazing medium for polling. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter have incorporated polling features into their status updates, making it easier than ever for users to generate and ask their followers questions. We used this to our advantage and, using Instagram and Twitter, polled our personal followers to see how books held up against movies. </p>
                    <p> After the polling window closed, we had just shy of 100 users, in total, respond to our polls (65 on Instagram, 31 on Twitter) As seen above, books won out over their movie counterparts. While this was only a general survey, it seems the peers we surround ourselves with would much rather read a novel than watch a movie. But let's look bigger... </p>

                    <p> Goodreads and IMDB are overall hubs for book-reading and movie-watching, respectively. Registered users of the sites can contribute their own synopses, comments, and, in this case, ratings to titles they have read/seen. Goodreads and IMDB, you can say, are the "wikipedias of entertainment" - as all of the site's content is user-submitted. For ratings, Goodreads and IMDB both use "star-rating" systems - where users rank content and then the ratings are averaged together. IMDB's rating system is based on 1 to 10 stars, while Goodreads is based on 1 to 5 stars - therefore we doubled Goodreads' average rating to make the above graph. </p>
                    <p> As previously said, The Data Dugongs have been looking at 231 entries in an attempt to solve the age-old rivalry between book and movie. When we put averaged the ratings of the 231 films and the 231 books they are based off of, the rating for the books overall triumphs over the overall rating for movies by 1.03 stars. </p>
                    <p> This data supports the aforementioned statement - "the book is better than the movie."  When looking at user-rated systems, it shows that the data is closer than we previously predicted. This was also supported by the social media polling. After posting a general poll, The Data Dugongs received quite a few messages: </p>
                    <p> - <i> "It depends," </i> one user wrote. </p>
                    <p> - <i> "Book, but sometimes it's easier to watch the movie then read the book" </i> </p>
                    <p> - <i> "I find the benefits of both" </i> </p>
                    <p> While the general question "book or movie?" varies from person to person, for the second time in a row: book wins. </p>

                    <p> Some of the most-anticipated movies of 2019 are adaptations -- <i> Five Feet Apart </i> , <i> Pet Sematery </i> , and even <i> It: Chapter 2 </i> will all hit the big-screen this year. And following the movie will be a whole credit that says it's based on a book! While novel adaptations are becoming more and more popular in Hollywood, that does not mean they will make any book into a movie nowadays. While they are not writing their own original stories, big Hollywood directors know what does and does not work in the realm of adaptations. The Data Dugongs took our magic list of 231 films and books, and plotted them as seen above.   </p>
                    <p> In the box-office recently, and as reflected by our findings, there seems to be a "Big 5" book genres that are then adapted into movies. Romance makes up the bulk of the top 5 with 24% (thanks <i> The Fault in Our Stars </i> and <i> Fifty Shades of Grey </i>), followed by Fantasy (21%), Action (20%), Science Fiction (19%), and Drama/Thrillers (16%). There is a method to their madness, as these genres continuously succeed in the box office, spawning sequels and lots and lots of revenue. </p>
